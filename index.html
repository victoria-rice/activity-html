    <h1>Some trick to Fish Keeping that are handy</h1> 
    
    <img src="images/fish-tropical.jpg" alt="Tropical Fish">

    <p>There are so many fish to choose from it can be daunting and confusing for beginners. Many people are put off fishkeeping because they choose the wrong fish for their tank and are unable to look after them. <strong>Choosing the right fish is very important</strong> but is not difficult providing you do a little research. What type of fish you ultimately get will depend mainly on a number our factors, as not all fish can live with one another.</p>
    
    <h2>Fresh Water</h2>

    <p>There are many differences when it comes to freshwater aquariums versus saltwater aquariums. These setups can be quite different when it comes to initial and ongoing costs, everyday chores and maintenance tasks and care requirements for the fish and inverts. Fresh water fish are typically less expensive and more harty to enviromental changes and adjustments. The start up costs for a fresh water fish tank is also considerably less. It is gennerally recomended that beginners go with a fresh water tank. 
    
    <h2>Salt Water</h2>

    <p>In general, keeping saltwater fish is more expensive and more difficult than keeping freshwater fish. However, once established they do seem to be less demanding and water quality tends to stay better in tanks using live rock. Live plants perform similar (albeit to a lower degree) functions in water filtration in a freshwater aquarium. If you've been keeping freshwater fish tanks for some time now successfully the switch to a saltwater aquarium should not be all that difficult. If you have the desire, the fortitude to do the necessary research before acquiring animals and aquarium equipment and the money necessary to run a saltwater aquarium, then by all means go for it! Once you get started you'll be wondering why it took you so long to get into the saltwater side of the hobby.</p>
    
    <h2>Aquarium Maintenance</h2>
    
    <h3>Daily:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>urn the aquarium lights on and off. Most aquarists prefer to use an automatic timer. If you choose not to, try to turn the lights on and off at the same times each day.</li>
        <li>Check your fish and invertebrates for signs of stress, disease, or death. Be prepared to remove or treat fish that aren't well.</li>
        <li>Feed the fishes and invertebrates twice a day, removing any uneaten food.</li>
        <li>Conduct water tests until the water matures and the nitrogen cycle is established. Routine tests include ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. Record the test results.</li>
        <li>Check the water temperature and specific gravity or salinity. Adjust the heater, as needed.</li>
        <li>Empty the protein skimmer collection cup, as needed.</li>
        <li>Check the water level and top off, as needed.</li>
        <li>Check all aquarium systems: heater, filters, aerators, protein skimmer. Make sure they're running properly and smoothly and pay special attention to intakes and siphon tubes. Make sure nothing is leaking.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Weekly:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Remove excess algae, keeping beneficial algae at acceptable levels and getting rid of nuisance algae.</li>
        <li>Clean the glass, both inside and out, but don't use glass cleaner. Remove salt-creep deposits.</li>
        <li>Conduct water tests weekly after the water matures and the nitrogen cycle is established. Record all test results and add trace elements and buffers, as needed.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Biweekly:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Clean filters, as needed. Partially change or rinse the filter media on some filters if the bioload is high, the media is dirty, or the flow is restricted.</li>
        <li>Change 10 percent of the tank water while vacuuming the gravel.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>monthly:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Conduct thorough filter checks. Replace the filter carbon and rinse the filter media and components, as needed and depending on bioload.</li>
    <li>Clean the protein skimmer.</li>
    <li>Clean the outside of aquarium, removing salt and calcium deposits, dust, and dirt.</li>
    <li>Rinse any tank decorations that suffer from excess algae.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Quarterly (every three months), conduct a thorough examination of all aquarium systems, including lighting, heating, filtration, aeration pumps, and tubing. Replace or clean parts, as needed.</p>
